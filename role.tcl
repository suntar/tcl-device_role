# Usage:
#
#   set dev [DeviceRole <name>:<channel> <role>]
#
#  <name>    - Device name in Device librarym,
#              should me configured in /etc/devices.txt
#  <channel> - A parameter for the driver. Can be a physical channel
#              for multi-channel devices, operation mode, or something
#              else. See documenation/code of specific drivers.
#  <role>    - A "role", some interface supported by the device
#              such as "gauge", "power_supply", "ac_source", etc.
#  <dev>     - a returned object which implements the role interface.
#
# Example:
#   set dev [DeviceRole ps0:1L power_supply]
#   $dev set_curr 0.1
#
# This means "use channel 1L of Device ps0 as a power_supply".
# power_supply commands can be founs in ./power_supply.tcl file.
# Channel can be set for some devices, see power_supply/*.tcl
