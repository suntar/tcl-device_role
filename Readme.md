# DeviceRole library -- standardized drivers for devices
---

## Ideology

This is a tcl library for implementing some special roles of devices used
in the Device library. For example you have a multimeter. Device library
only knows a name of this device (say mult0) and how it is connected. It
can transfer commands to the device, but it knows nothing about its model
and capabilities.

DeviceRole library can autodetect device model and use a driver with some
standard interface. Client only knows, that the role of device "mult0" is
a "gauge", and thus it has a get_volt command. This device roles are not
universal. All real devices have different capabilities, but in many
cases some simple operations are needed, then DeviceRole library can be
useful. One physical device can work in defferent roles.

Usage:
```tcl
Package require DeviceRole
set dev [DeviceRole mult0:DCV gauge]
set v [dev get_volt]
if {[DeviceRoleExists $dev]} {do_something}
DeviceRoleDelete $dev
```

Here we use a "channel" setting `:DCV` to tell the library that we want
to masure DC voltage. Driver for the specific multimeter device should
know what is this channel setting means. As an another example we can
work with a 4-channel power-supply frame using numerical channel settings
`ps:1` .. `ps:4`.

`DeviceRoleDelete` command deletes the `DeviceRole` object. It keeps
a reference counter for low-level Device objects and closes them if
it is needed.

#### Locks

Library provides access to locks implemented in Device library.
Every driver has following commands (see Device library documentation for
more infomation):
```tcl
* lock   -- lock the device
* unlock -- unlock the device
```

TODO: channel-specific locks.


#### Test devices

Some roles have a TEST device which is not connected to any phisycal
device and produce some fake data. You can use it for testing:

```tcl
set dev [DeviceRole TEST power_supply]
```
